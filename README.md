Testing sprite sheet options
============================

Go to
[frunit.github.io/spritetest?round_pixels=0&scale_mode=0](https://frunit.github.io/spritetest?round_pixels=0&scale_mode=0)
and zoom in and out (far out!) by pinching with two fingers or with your
mouse wheel. You will see that the grey background tiles will be
interspersed with red lines bleeding through from the background at some
zoom levels, but only in the parts where the grey background is included
from a sprite sheet.

The single background file included as a single image is in the upper
left. The same image but in a sprite sheet with two pixels transparency
around is used in the lower left. The upper right shows the same image,
but with one additional pixel of color (well, grey) around it.

**How do I get the results of the upper left part using not a single
image but a sprite sheet?**
